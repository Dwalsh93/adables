With this project my main goal was to have it look as close to the mock-up as possible. I started with the header and hero image, creating navigations links and then began working on the body. The goal was to having a working portfolio to be able to add to throughout the coding bootcamp so I feel comfortable saying that this portfolio will work for that.
